    "text = \"Gold Forecast: Hovering Between Moving Averages. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well. Gold markets initially tried to rally during the course of the trading session on Thursday but failed to continue going higher at the 200 day EMA as it continues to be quite resistive. At this point, the market then felt to reach down below the 50 day EMA, which of course was a very negative sign. However, by the end of the session we turned around to break above the 50 day EMA and now it looks like the market is essentially doing the same thing it has been doing for several days. These are two major averages that a lot of people pay attention to, so it should not be overly surprising that we are stuck in this general vicinity. Furthermore, you have to pay close attention to the US dollar, because the gold market is highly influenced by it. Now that that we have broken down below the 50 day EMA, it looks like the market is finding value hunters underneath just above the $1750 level. I think what we are looking at here is a market that is trying to figure out where we are getting ready to go longer term. When you look at the charts you can see that we have formed a double bottom just below the $1700 level, so I think if we break down below the $1750 level, then we will go testing that area. However, the $1750 level above had been resisted previously, broken out above, and now has been retested. At this point, we have to question whether or not this attempt to form a basing pattern has started to stick? A break above the $1800 level opens up the possibility of a much bigger move, and therefore I think that is the key for buying this market. Until then, I would be hesitant to put a lot of money into the gold market, but it certainly looks as if we are trying to turn things around. It could be very noisy over the next couple of weeks, but I do have my eye on this market as a confirmation of the return could very well send this market looking towards the highs again. Pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then I believe that gold should do fairly well\"\n",

      "European stocks rely on stable investment sentiment in the early stage. The economic growth in the United States in the first quarter was better than expected, and the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time last week decreased. Coupled with the Fed&#39;s dovish remarks, the market sentiment was positive, and European stock markets stabilized in the early stages. As of 3:40 pm Hong Kong time, the UK FTSE 100 Index reported 6985 points, up 24 points or 0.35%; Germany’s DAX Index reported 15,228 points, up 73 points or 0.49%; France’s CAC 40 Index reported 6316 points, up 14 points Or 0.23%; Italy&#39;s FTSE MIB index reported 24387 points, up 109 points or 0.45%. Dow futures temporarily reported 33,909 points, down 42 points. The initial value of the US gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter increased by 6.4% annually. Although it was lower than the 6.7% expected, it was significantly faster than the 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. During the period, personal consumption rose 10.7%, slightly higher than estimated . The London copper futures rose above the level of US$10,000 per ton. It reached a high of US$10,008 earlier, which is close to the high of US$10,190 in 2011, and it has recently softened to US$9,881. The price of Ethereum, the world&#39;s second-largest cryptocurrency, hit a record high on Thursday. According to Coindesk data, the price of Ether has risen to a record high of US$2,800 in the past 24 hours. The latest price is still up 1.72% to US$2,780.19. Bitcoin (Bitcoin) slightly improved, quoted at $54,440.91. The US economy is in good condition, which has caused US bond yields to rise. The latest 10-year US bond yield was reported at 1.645%; spot gold was reported at US$1,770.87 per ounce. Oil prices have softened. New York crude oil futures are currently quoted at US$64.71 per barrel, down US$0.29 or 0.45%; London Brent oil futures are reported at US$68.38, down US$0.18 or 0.26%.\n",

      "3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks - The Motley Fool UK. In for a penny, in for a pound? Penny stocks can seem appealing. The idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling. But there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks. Here are three I’ve observed. Focus on price not value Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy — or the most expensive. Which would I prefer? The answer seems obvious. For most people, quality is worth paying for. Yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value. The legendary investor Warren Buffett said that “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. A penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value. But to assess what the underlying value is, I’d look not just at the price. I’dd also consider the company’s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value. Penny stocks and balance sheets One common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company’s balance sheet. Imagine buying a second hand car for £100. That might sound like a bargain. But if it needs to have an MOT the following week that identifies £3,000 of necessary repairs, even the £100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect. It’s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources. How will it pay them? Will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like Hammerson did last year? Balance sheets scare many people. But they aren’t as technical as they may sound. Before investing in any penny stocks I’d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company’s recent balance sheets. Seeing what a company’s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health, in my view. Single-asset focus A lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset. I find that’s particularly true with early-stage resource stocks. For example, Bacanora Lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in Mexico. Sometimes, such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards. If a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold, its return on capital could be huge. But the reverse is true as well – if a company is over-concentrated in one asset, the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it. Single-asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk, in many cases. That matters because, as Warren Buffett reminds us: “Rule number one: never lose money. Rule number two: never forget rule number one”. That can be hard to do. But by learning from common mistakes other investors make, I hope I can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio. \n",

      "Advertorial (?) in the Australian from Anzac Day ..cheers https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dgo-gold-aiming-to-strike-a-balance-in-gold-exploration/news-story/231d9ce048bfd7d7f87545741008db15DGO Gold aiming to strike a balance in gold explorationDGO Gold is hoping it has created a strategic investment model that will reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia. Picture: BloombergDAMON KITNEYVICTORIAN BUSINESS EDITOR6:42PM APRIL 25, 2021Melbourne investment banker Bruce Parncutt calls his latest plaything a “gold discovery company”.Neither an explorer nor a miner, the ASX-listed DGO Gold — of which Mr Parncutt has been an executive director for the past year — is looking to carve out a unique niche in the Australian gold sector.Its game plan is to make strategic equity investments in West Australian brownfield gold discoveries, bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely-ignored exploration opportunities.Mr Parncutt said he hopes DGO has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia.“Gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation. We do the mining part well but I’m not so sure we do the exploration part well. Especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale,” he said. “Most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore. We think we are adding intelligent value to that process.” DGO is also a unique human story, combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of McIntosh Securities in Mr Parncutt, with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector’s most famed geologists, Ed Eshuys.As Joseph Gutnick’s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr Eshuys led the teams that discovered the Plutonic, Bronzewing and Jundee gold deposits and the Cawse nickel deposit. Before those triumphs, Mr Eshuys also had involvement in the Maggie Hays and Mariners nickel discoveries in the 1970s.He is now DGO Gold’s executive chairman and is working closely with Mr Parncutt — who has been on the board since 2018 — and DGO’s management team to develop two sizeable WA gold resources and to explore for more.“We do bring together a unique set of skills. It is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills” Mr Eshuys said.“Bruce and I do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus. That has led us to a disciplined approach to take DGO from where it was to where it is now.”DGO Gold directors Ed Eshuys and Bruce Parncutt.DGO Gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects. Ten ASX juniors made the shortlist before DGO narrowed it down to two, taking strategic stakes in booming Pilbara gold explorer De Grey Mining and Leonora gold explorer NTM Gold.DGO has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled, including on prime South Australian ground owned by junior explorer Investigator Resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter’s Pernatty copper project. DGO also has a 40 per cent interest in Yilgarn Exploration Ventures, which is drilling in the Leonora district of Western Australia.“One of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn’t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale,” Mr Eshuys said.“Part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly. That is where De Grey came to the party. They did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that.”The strategy has seen DGO Gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago, and $1.70 last year when Mr Parncutt became an executive, to close on Friday at $3.63.They soared over $4 in September last year on the back of the coronavirus-fuelled surge in the gold price, which saw it spike to $US2056 per ounce last August.While gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising US Treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery, the DGO share price has held up.DGO now owns 16 per cent of De Grey, which is drilling out a significant Pilbara gold discovery. It also has board representation and has supported De Grey’s capital raisings, including a $25m round last September.“De Grey is in a unique position in terms of its Pilbara land position. That is one of our key elements when we invest and explore,” Mr Eshuys said.Following the merger late last year of NTM Gold with Dacian Gold, DGO will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in Dacian.Of the $25m raised last September, $8m was also pegged for greenfield exploration.The value of DGO’s stake in De Grey covers its $225m market capitalisation, meaning the market is currently attributing no value to DGO’s substantial exploration interests.DGO has attracted some big name investors, including stockbroking veteran Tom Klinger, one of Christopher Skase’s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former McIntosh managing director. Others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser Peter Woodford, the rich-lister Costa family member Robert Costa and Regal Funds Management.\n",

      "Global gold demand, first quarter near low level for the first time in 13 years Investor sales. [London, 29th Reuters] --Global gold demand in the first quarter of this year has remained near its lowest level since 2008, according to a quarterly report released by the World Gold Council (WGC), an international gold research institute. It was. While Asian consumer buying has returned, investor sales have expanded in Europe and North America. Last year, as the spread of the new coronavirus hit the global economy, investors were increasingly buying gold as a safe haven. At the same time, lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have slowed sales of gold jewelery, gold nuggets and gold coins in China and India, which are normally the two biggest consumers. As the global economy recovers, this trend is now reversing, with investors shrinking their holdings and Asian consumer buying returning. According to the WGC, global gold demand from January to March this year was 815.7 tons, a slight increase from 813.7 tons in the previous quarter. However, it decreased by 23% year-on-year. Consumer demand in China was 286.4 tonnes, the highest level since the first quarter of 2017. On the other hand, exchange-traded fund (ETF) gold holdings fell by 177.9 tons, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2013. Due to the sale by ETF, the gold price fell from the record high of 1 ounce = $ 2072.50 in August last year to around $ 1,700 in March. According to the WGC, this helped boost demand for Asians. In April, ETF sales slowed sharply and gold prices picked up towards $ 1800. WGC analyst Christian Gopaul said consumers and investors&#39; demand for gold this year is likely to remain resilient, albeit below its recent peak. Gold purchased by the central bank in the first quarter was 95.5 tonnes, the highest level since the second quarter of last year. However, it was well below the typical level seen in 2018 and 2019.

      "Under-supplied metal palladium races past $3,000/oz for first time. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT.       Palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on Friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. Palladium was last up 1% to $2,984.68 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3,007.73. It was on track to post a monthly gain as well. \"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. \"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\" Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. But Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. \"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\" A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,769.00. Data showed on Thursday that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. Separately, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Silver fell 0.5% to $25.96 per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last December. Platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Peter Hobson in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)    Dear Reader,  Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

      "China&#39;s gold production in the first quarter shrinks by 10% and consumption is 94%. The China Gold Association announced that the domestic raw material gold production in the first quarter of this year was 74.44 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 9.92%. Among them, China National Gold, Shandong Gold, Zijin Mining, Shandong Zhaojin and other large gold conglomerates produced 30.78 tons of mineral gold, accounting for the proportion of the country. Up to 52.25%. According to the association, the actual consumption of gold in the country during the period was 288.2 tons, an increase of 93.9% year-on-year. Among them, gold jewellery was 169.18 tons, an increase of 83.81%. Based on the low base caused by the outbreak in the same period last year, and the results of China&#39;s overall epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development gradually appearing, the gold consumption in the first quarter has returned to the level of the same period in 2019. The scale of domestic gold ETFs continued to grow in the first quarter, with a total increase of 11.5 tons. As of the end of March, domestic gold ETF holdings were about 72.4 tons. The association stated that high-quality resources and high-quality productivity are further concentrated in large gold companies. The fall in gold prices has also prompted an increase in demand from industrial gold companies. The improvement in the macro economy and the fall in gold prices have caused physical gold investment to continue the high heat in the fourth quarter of last year, with a sharp rise year-on-year. In the first quarter of 2021, with the turnaround of the global epidemic and the steady progress of vaccination, as well as the continuous strengthening of the U.S. dollar under the large-scale fiscal stimulus of the Biden government of the United States, the price of gold fluctuated and corrected during the period.\n",
