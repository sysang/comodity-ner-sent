Shooter Dane Sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third Olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the South Australia championships. Sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. The performance bettered Sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's Wingfield grand prix. The score was also notably higher than what Italy's Niccolo Campriani (458.8) and Poland's Tomasz Bartnik (460.4) produced to win gold at the 2016 Olympics and 2018 world championships respectively. \"It's good to be shooting PBs at this stage. It was a world-class finals score,\" Sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. \"You are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. \"I definitely feel that I am getting better and better and I am tracking well for Tokyo.\" Sampson and other members of Australia's shooting team for the 2021 Olympics are set to come together for a pre-Games camp on July 4-19. The camp is intended to mimic the biosecurity bubble and strict protocols that await in Tokyo."

      "text": "What’s your role in AngloGold Ashanti? – Sam Jonah questioned. After his public address to Rotary Club in Accra, Sam Kwesi Esson Jonah KBE, has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the Executive. The latest criticism is coming from Paul Adom-Otchere, host of Good Evening Ghana (GEG), who in his biweekly show on Metro TV, tried to ‘punch holes’ in the senior stateman’s speech. According to him, Sam Jonah KBE, must have had a role in Ashanti Gold which later turned into AngloGold Ashanti, therefore, he should be able to tell the young people of Ghana the role he played while working with the company. On his show, Thursday, April 29, 2021, Adom-Otchere stated that, if Sam Jonah KBE wants to talk about the future of Ghana, then he must first of all open up about his past. “Sam Jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past...it behoves him to make statements about his past. If he won’t say anything at all, at least we know his role with Adisadel College and AshGold Football Club, we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society, the Ashanti transaction,” Paul Adom-Otchere said on his show monitored by GhanaWeb. He indicated that, there are two Ashanti transactions, one was failed by the government of Ghana, which left a lot of rancour’s between JJ Rawlings and Sam Jonah and their relationship broke off completely. “We don’t know the details. Sam Jonah must come and tell us. And then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002, this time it was supported by the JA Kufuor government and it was successful. In both transactions, there was a critical decision about the heritage of the Ghanaian young person; because this gold resource, which is a Ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way, was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today Sam Jonah is concerned about? “Was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future? Was there an option with Randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of Ghana?” he asked. Adom-Otchere stressed that, Sam Jonah KBE must answer these questions. “He [Sam Jonah] is a big man, he has been around for a very long time, and he comes and says the youth of Ghana, I now feel the responsibility to speak and you don’t tell us what you’ve been doing in the past, when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of Ghana since 1983; you won’t tell us what has happened about that…?” Paul Adom-Otchere argues that, Sam Jonah’s answer to the question will help the Ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea. “So that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time. If that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time, it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important,” he stressed."

(\"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiaries (together \"Komatsu\") have engaged in the three- year mid-term management plan (FY2019 - 2021), \"DANTOTSU Value - FORWARD Together for Sustainable Growth\" for its 100th anniversary in 2021 and beyond. Under the mid-term management plan, launched in April 2019, Komatsu upholds three pillars of growth strategies of 1) value creation by means of innovation, 2) growth strategies based on business reforms, and 3) structural reforms for growth. While economic activities remain sluggish due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Komatsu will continue to make efforts for sustainable growth through a positive cycle of improving earnings and solving ESG issues into the future. For the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021), the second year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 2,189.5 billion, down 10.4% from the previous fiscal year. Under unclear and uncertain conditions as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in the second six-month period. However, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as full-year demand was critically affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In the industrial machinery and others business, sales fell from the previous fiscal year, as affected by sluggish capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools. With respect to profits for the fiscal year under review, operating income dropped by 33.3% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 167.3 billion. This was mainly due to reduced sales volume, and changes in the compositions of sales, in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen's appreciation, even while Komatsu worked to reduce fixed costs. The operating income ratio decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 7.6%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies fell by 27.0% to JPY 162.7 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. totaled JPY 106.2 billion, down 30.9%.

Business results by operation are described below. Construction, Mining and Utility Equipment For the fiscal year under review, sales of the construction, mining and utility equipment business decreased by 10.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 1,975.9 billion. Segment profit fell by 36.7% to JPY 143.7 billion. Komatsu promoted efforts of focus defined in the three pillars of growth strategies in the mid-term management plan. With respect to automation, autonomy, electrification, and remote control of construction, mining, and utility equipment, i.e., an effort of focus in value creation by means of innovation, Komatsu continued to strengthen the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) for mining, increasing the total number of AHS trucks in operation to 352 units as of March 31, 2021. Komatsu also advanced remote control verification tests of the large ICT-intensive mining bulldozer D375Ai-8 over commercial 5G network, while continuing efforts to develop an optimization platform designed to improve the safety and optimize operations at customers' mines. Concerning electrification of construction equipment, Komatsu embarked on PoC (Proof of Concept) verification tests of small and medium-sized hydraulic excavators powered by the lithium-ion battery system. With respect to the \"SMARTCONSTRUCTION Digital Transformation\", a solutions business for construction workplaces, Komatsu is appealing its role as a solution provider to help customers optimize their construction work. To accelerate the pace of achieving digital transformation of construction workplaces, Komatsu continued to promoted the installation of its retrofit kits, which offer ICT functions to conventional construction equipment. Concerning an effort of focus of the growth strategies based on business reforms, Komatsu strengthened the recycle-oriented business, establishing a new Reman plant in Southern Africa for the Reman business which remanufactures and reuses components. In the forest machinery business, Komatsu also strengthened the market introduction of machines designed to promote silviculture (growing and cultivating forest crops). As part of the structural reforms for growth, Komatsu continued its efforts to reassess Komatsu Mining Corp.'s unprofitable business and optimize their production capacity by restructuring production of underground coal mining equipment, selling its conveyor business in the United States and Australia, and transferring its production of roof supports in the United Kingdom.

Japan For the fiscal year under review, demand remained steady, centering on public works, on which the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a small impact. Nevertheless, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as adversely affected by slack private-sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six-month period. Americas In North America, sales dropped from the previous fiscal year. While demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry, it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy-related sector. In Latin America, demand for construction equipment remained steady in Brazil, and sales of mining equipment increased to Chilean copper mines. However, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in the first six- month period. Europe and CIS In Europe, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as demand remained sluggish in the first six-month period, although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the major markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as in Italy. In CIS, sales declined, affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the Russian ruble, while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy-related sectors. China While the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased, demand remained steady, supported by the government's economic stimulus measures, such as infrastructure investment, after containing the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Furthermore, demand advanced in the fiscal year under review, driven by the post-Chinese New Year sales season in February, and because the previous year's sales season in February was pushed back by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, sales increased from the previous fiscal year. Asia and Oceania In Asia, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in Indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices. However, sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year, as particularly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. In Oceania, sales increased, supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines, as well as for construction equipment. Middle East and Africa In the Middle East, sales improved from the previous fiscal year, supported by steady demand, especially in Turkey, while demand remained slack in Saudi Arabia, largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In Africa, demand for construction equipment remained slack in Southern Africa, mainly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions, sales declined, as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well. Retail Finance While assets increased, reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on North America as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter, revenues decreased by 6.4% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 66.3 billion, as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine-month period. Segment profit fell by 16.6% to JPY 10.5 billion, mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use. Industrial Machinery and Others For the fiscal year under review, sales fell by 3.6% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 171.2 billion. This was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, as well as their delayed installation at customers' overseas workplaces, especially under the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Meanwhile, segment profit increased by 19.3% to JPY 16.3 billion, as sales remained steady for Excimer laser-related business in the semiconductor market. [Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2022] (From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review, returning to the level prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By region, Komatsu anticipates demand will expand, especially in Asia, North America and Latin America. In China, Komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review, when the post-Chinese New Year sales season occurred twice. Nevertheless, Komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review. Furthermore, Komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore, copper, and gold mines, while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines. With respect to profits, Komatsu expects that they will advance, reflecting an increase in volume of sales, differences in composition of sales, and improved selling prices. In the retail finance business, Komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve, mainly due to an increase in new contracts. In the industrial machinery and others business, Komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as sales of machine tools and the Excimer laser-related business should grow, respectively, in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market. As preconditions for its projection, Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: USD1=JPY 105.0, EUR1=JPY 124.0, and RMB1=JPY 16.0.

(2) Financial Conditions As of March 31, 2021, while inventories decreased from the previous fiscal year-end, total assets increased by JPY 131.1 billion to JPY 3,784.8 billion, due largely to the Japanese yen's depreciation against the U.S. dollar and some other currencies as well as increased receivables. Interest-bearing debt decreased by JPY 102.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 909.9 billion. Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity increased by JPY 140.6 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to JPY 1,912.2 billion. As a result, Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' ratio increased by 2.0 percentage points from the previous fiscal year-end, to 50.5%. For the fiscal year under review, net cash provided by operating activities totaled JPY 354.1 billion, an increase of JPY 58.9 billion from the previous fiscal year, largely reflecting decreased inventories. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to JPY 163.0 billion, a decrease of JPY 27.8 billion from the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to JPY 199.6 billion (as compared to JPY 3.4 billion used for the previous fiscal year), mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of cash dividends. After adding the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations to the total amount of each cash flow, as of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled JPY 241.8 billion, a decrease of JPY 5.8 billion from the previous fiscal year-end. [Trends of Financial Conditions Indicators] (Fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019) 2021 2020 2019 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio (%) 50.5 48.5 49.9 Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market 85.4 46.0 66.7 value (%) Years of debt redemption 2.6 3.4 4.6 Notes: 1) Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio: Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity/Total assets           Komatsu Ltd. shareholders' equity ratio at aggregate market value: Aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock/Total assets    Years of debt redemption: Interest-bearing debt/Net cash provided by operating activities     Basic Policy for Redistribution of Profits and Dividends for the Fiscal Year under Review and Next Fiscal Year    Komatsu is building a sound financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in order to increase its sustainable corporate value. Concerning cash dividends, Komatsu has the policy of continuing stable payment of dividends after comprehensively considering consolidated business results and reviewing future investment plans, cash flows and the like. Specifically, Komatsu has the policy of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher. As described earlier in this report, while demand declined in the construction, mining, and utility equipment business, as adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it has recovered sooner than expected, since the third quarter, centering on construction equipment. As a result, both sales and profits for the year outperformed the projection of consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which Komatsu announced on October 28, 2020. Concerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects under its dividend policy, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 2 from the earlier projection of JPY 25 per share. At the same time, the Company plans to pay the 100th anniversary (May 13, 2021) commemorative cash dividend of JPY 10 per share. As a result, year-end cash dividends for the fiscal year under review should amount to JPY 37 per share, i.e., JPY 12 more than the latest projection of cash dividends. Annual cash dividends should total JPY 55 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which is showing a decrease of JPY 39 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the consolidated payout ratio will translate into 48.9%. This dividend amount will be proposed to the 152nd ordinary general meeting of shareholders (scheduled for June 18, 2021). Regarding annual cash dividends for the fiscal year, ending March 31, 2022, the Company plans to pay JPY 62 per share, an increase of JPY 7 per share from the fiscal year under review.

China News Service, Putian, April 29 (Reporter Lin Chunyin) The 15th China (Putian) Strait Handicraft Fair opened on the 29th in Putian. Tens of thousands of cross-strait arts and crafts made a stunning appearance and 36 Taiwan companies participated in the exhibition. Lin Yunan, secretary-general of Taiwan&#39;s Top Craft Association, said that the cross-strait arts and crafts exchanges &quot;unstop&quot; and &quot;uninterrupted&quot;, and hope that Taiwanese arts and crafts can bloom in the mainland market. . The theme of this year’s art fair is &quot;Craftsmanship on both sides of the strait, quality of life&quot;. Putian Arts and Crafts City has the main venue, China Classical Arts and Crafts Expo City, Xianyou Strait Art Sculpture Tourism City, China Chenqiao Furniture Park, Shangtang Jewelry City, and Putian International The Oil Painting City, Meijia Meiju New Retail Center, Beigao Gold and Jewelry Industrial Park and Putian Art Museum have 8 sub-venues, and 4 award competitions will be held at the same time. The &quot;cross-strait&quot; element has been the highlight of this year&#39;s art fair as always. The organizer said that due to the control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Taiwanese craftsmen could not go to Putian to participate in the exhibition, but this year, the number of Taiwanese companies participating in this year has increased to 32 compared with the previous exhibition. They are divided into Taiwan&#39;s top crafts association, Fujian and Taiwan folk crafts painted traditional lanterns, and Taiwan cultural and creative The Society won 46 booths in three exhibition halls. This year&#39;s art fair awarded Putian City as the &quot;Cross-Strait Arts and Crafts Innovation and Integration Demonstration Base&quot;, and continued to promote the deepening of exchanges and cooperation in arts and crafts industries across the Taiwan Strait. During the 7-day exhibition, the 12th &quot;Yiding Cup&quot; Chinese Wood Carving Site Creation Competition, the 7th Chinese Clay Modeling Skills Competition, and the 11th Fujian Province Arts and Crafts Fine Arts &quot;Zhengyan Cup&quot; Competition were held concurrently. A new national-level award competition-the 2021 &quot;Zhongjiang Cup&quot; China Arts and Crafts Creative Design Competition. Lin Yunan, secretary-general of Taiwan’s Top Crafts Association, told reporters from China News Agency that she was concerned about the &quot;prosperity&quot; presented in the above-mentioned competitions. Creative passion.&quot; Lin Yunan said that the epidemic has blocked normal cross-strait exchanges. Since last year, she has been based in Fujian to find the mainland market for Taiwan exhibits. The information on cross-strait cooperation trends revealed at this year&#39;s art fair has attracted much attention. The exchanges should not stop and cannot be interrupted.” Lin Yun’an also said that she is paying attention to Fujian’s first attempt to include Taiwanese craftsmen in the list of inheritors of intangible cultural heritage, and to give preference to inheritance policies. “There are more and more cultural support policies that benefit Taiwanese. It is conducive to the diversified inheritance of Chinese traditional skills and is worth looking forward to.&quot; (Editor in charge: Song Yajing)"

      "text": "Originally posted by kervio: ↑ I think the update said median age of the first set of patients was around mid 50s and median age of the later set of patients was around 69, so they would have only had to have put the inclusion criteria in half way through the trial when the evidence was emerging that age was a huge factor in deaths in order to have a successful trial. This is the big \"what if\" that might have sent the SP to $10, FDA approval, lives saved etc.We can give them a pass on not knowing that up front for sure because of the speed in which the trial moved forwards on, but I think some reactivity would have saved the day here once more was known about covid (in the same way that we found out about comorbidities leading to higher rates of death).I disagree with this: \"This disease has been totally wacky in respect of different age cohorts, and no one has or has had any idea what is going to happen to any given age group once confronted with the disease or results/impact. COVID has everyone flummoxed.\" until the Brazil variant turned everything on its head (which happened after the trial) there was lots of clear evidence in white papers about the effect of age on covid mortality. The inclusion criteria is there to stop random chance from derailing your study, so if they had say 10 or so 80yo patients that were enrolled and bound to die no matter what it lessons the effect of your treatment on a saveable demographic within your cohort. I agree with your excitement on what the results though, and I think this therapy has some big potential to show effect and get approval in a confirmatory trial with appropriate design. It's better than I expected the results to be. Expand Hey,@kervio. Good points on age effect. I guess I was thinking more broadly, say in respect of MIS-C in kids, under-50s getting blood clots with the Astra Zeneca and J&J vaccines, etc. A lot about COVID has been very unpredictable.As well, we don't know what conversations, if any, were had between MSB, NIH, the FDA and the DSMB. Clearly, someone made the decision not to modify the inclusion criteria and continue the trial, opting to halt it, instead. Most likely NOT MSB's choice, and I doubt they would have been given enough information by the DSMB to allow them to make this call on their own. I am clearly not qualified to speak on the issue, of course!LeftYahoo had a good point about the silver lining here, though - we get the full trial results that much earlier, with it having been halted. Fingers crossed the NIH, the FDA and Novartis are as excited about these amazing results as we are!"

      "text": "Watch the visuals of KDDO and Davido’s ‘Beamer Body’. KDDO has finally released the visuals for the Davido-assisted song Beamer Body , which is from the stable of Sony Music Entertainment West Africa and Pentlife Music. KDDO first teased the collaboration in the final quarter of last year, and it’s been highly-anticipated ever since. The release of this new banger is also sequel to the successful run of his recent and critically acclaimed Amapiano music hit,   eWallet  that shook the nation with style. Speaking on the track, KDDO remembers linking up with music heavyweight, Davido while on tour last year in Las Vegas to record  Beamer Body . “I had already started working on the single back in LA. Davido and I were playing music back at the hotel in Vegas, then the beat came on and we were all just vibing. David really liked it, he got mad hyped about it and added a verse on the spot”  says KDDO. While  Beamer Body  beat is infectious and attacked with melodies from the musical duo, its focal message (adequately represented in glimpses from the music video directed by Chris Simon) seeks to empower beautiful women from around the world to be comfortable in their bodies. “ Feel sexy, baby! There’s something about you ,” KDDO adds.   Interestingly, “ Beamer Body ” also serves as the lead single to his forth-coming debut EP project Too Late Too Lit , which is now available for  pre-order/pre-save  on music streaming platforms. The EP has been designed to be a feel-good body of work for the fans and we probably have the pandemic to thank for catalysing KDDO’s efforts to drop. KDDO will continue his genius operation from his base in Los Angeles, building upon his laurels in music some of which already include “ 1st Afrobeats RIAA Gold Award ”; “ Producer of The Year ”; “ Music Producer of the Year ”; “ Longest-charting Nigerian pop song in Billboard history  ( Fall  performed by Davido)”; “ Top 100 most Shazam-ed singles in America ”; “ 1st Nigerian producer to sell multi-platinum in South Africa ,” and also extending his collaborative reach beyond the prominence of superstars Davido, Chris Brown, AKA, Mayorkun, Cardi B, Beyonce and Popcaan.

      "text": "Man Utd hammer Roma 6-2 in Europa League semi-final. Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani both scored twice as Manchester United came from behind to take a major step towards sealing a place in next month’s Europa League final. Fernandes gave United a perfect start in their semi-final with Italian side Roma when he swept home Cavani’s first-time lay-off. Paul Pogba’s handball allowed Lorenzo Pellegrini to equalise before the Roma skipper’s pass allowed former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko to score his sixth goal in five Old Trafford appearances to turn the tie on its head by half-time. But United rallied after the break. Cavani levelled with a superb first-time effort before tapping the hosts back in front when substitute keeper Antonio Mirante pushed Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s angled shot into his path. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men were in no mood to let their advantage slip a second time, although it took a fortunate penalty for what seemed to be an innocuous Chris Smalling tackle on Cavani to give Fernandes the chance add a fourth from the spot. Pogba then powered home a precise header from Fernandes’ cross before Greenwood ran on to Cavani’s pass and drove home United’s sixth, making them the first side to score six goals in a major European semi-final since Real Madrid in the 1964 European Cup. The final scoreline did not quite match United’s epic 7-1 Champions League triumph against the same opponents in 2007 but for Solskjaer, a substitute on that famous night, it was just as sweet. After four successive semi-final defeats in 15 months, the Norwegian really needs to get beyond that stage to silence his doubters, some of whom were never convinced he should have succeeded Jose Mourinho as United boss and point to an absence of silverware that both his predecessor and Louis van Gaal delivered in shorter reigns at the club. Solskjaer’s double fist-pump reaction to Cavani’s equaliser underlined the importance of the Uruguayan’s superb effort, swept into the top corner and part of a two-goal, three-assist contribution from the striker, whose contract expires in the summer. For once, it meant Fernandes had to share top billing as he claimed two assists to go with his brace – although after a below-par couple of months, the Portuguese seems to have recovered his form at the right time. Pogba is United’s other big-name player and the midfielder ended an up-and-down night very much on the positive side, celebrating his header in style as the pressure was released. Greenwood’s effort means only a catastrophe in the second leg can prevent United reaching their eighth European final.  – BBC"

The economic growth in the United States in the first quarter was better than expected, and the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time last week decreased.

      "text": "Nars Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer new shades: our honest review. As our social calendars are refilling once again, it’s time to dust off your makeup bag. If your once beloved products are looking past their sell by date - we have good news. NARS has relaunched its iconic , which is now available in 16 shades for a more inclusive selection than ever. A hybrid between foundation and moisturiser, the multitasking product is ideal for creating the coveted ‘skinmalism’ natural makeup look. It packs your skin with hydration, while treating it to a fresh-from-holiday glow. NARS’ Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer has long been a favourite among those in the know with its buildable, oil-free formula. It has SPF30 and contains the powerhouse combination of antioxidant-rich vitamin C to protect your skin against environmental aggressors and leave a radiant finish as well as French Polynesian Kopara to nourish and refine your complexion. “I am crazy about healthy beautiful skin!”, explains François Nars, NARS Founder & Creative Director. “I love the weightless texture, rich pigment, and the glow that this product gives to any and every complexion. It is wonderful for all skin types and has a sheerness that allows for your skin’s unique qualities to shine through. It’s also totally effortless.” The ES Best Shopping team took four shades of the  for a spin - here’s what we thought. Ellie Davis Acting Shopping Editor Shades: Light 3 Groenland (for light skin with peach undertones) & Light 2 Alaska (for light skins with golden undertones) After nearing a year of not wearing makeup, this tinted moisturiser from NARS acted as the perfect stepping stone I needed after the restrictions eased. I must admit, I feel a bit rusty on the makeup front but this product was a breeze, giving my skin the hydration it desperately needs while coating it with good, buildable coverage and a luminous glow. It is more pigmented than some of the other tinted moisturisers on the market, which was a welcomed treat to my very pale lockdown complexion. I went for two different shades; Alaska and Groenland - the former to suit my aforementioned Vitamin D-deficient skin and the other after a good tanning session courtesy of . I applied the product with a damp Beauty Blender and it went on a treat, spreading seamlessly over my skin. Foolproof. Abha Shah, Digital Shopping Writer Shades: Med-Deep 1 Santiago (For mediumdeep skin with subtle golden undertones) and Med-Deep 2 Marrakesh (For medium-deep skin with olive undertones) I’ve always thought the point of makeup is being able to see it. Why bother otherwise? At least, I had thought that until the pandemic put my makeup kit on furlough. For the best really, my skin needed the break. Now we’ve been given the green light to venture out into the world, it feels strange to apply the full face I used to do on autopilot in the mornings. The arrival of NARS’s new tinted moisturiser feels timely. Available in 16 shades, there were a few options for my Indian skin. I plumped for Santiago, which suits medium deep skin with subtle golden undertones, and Marrakesh, made for medium-deep skin with olive undertones. Squeezing the tube, I was at first dubious over NARS description of this product as a moisturiser - it very much looks like foundation. But I soon found it’s far thinner, leaving my pores ‘dressed’ but feeling as though they could ‘breathe’. The first ‘coat’, while still allowing stubborn acne scars to show through, balanced the medley of tones across my face well. Not a full makeover but rather, a gentle fine-tuning. The Tinted Moisturiser is easily buildable if you want to strengthen your base, but it also pairs well with concealer and bronzer, offering a mildly polished look that feels comfortable as I prepare for the great re-emergence. I’d happily wear this to the office, and save the stronger stuff for a big night out. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Read More"

      "text": "Tokyo's key Nikkei index opens lower. TOKYO: Tokyo's key Nikkei 225 index opened lower on Friday in subdued trade during Japan's Golden Week holiday period. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.35 percent or 100.89 points at 28,953.08 in early trade, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.06 percent or 1.06 points to 1,910.12. Investors were closing their positions after a national holiday on Thursday and ahead of an extended weekend that will see the market closed from Monday until Wednesday. Normal trading will resume from Thursday. \"In early trade, selling related to position adjustments ahead of the holiday period are dominating the market, rather than the market reflecting strong US shares,\" Okasan Online Securities said. On Wall Street, the Dow finished up 0.7 percent, as did the S&P 500. The tech-rich Nasdaq rose 0.2 percent. The Tokyo market remained well supported following the US Federal Open Market Committee's latest meeting, while investors digested the Biden administration's policy announcement, analysts said. Worries over the Olympics were also weighing on the Tokyo market. \"There are lingering speculations about the possible cancellation of the Olympics, which make Japanese shares unattractive to buy,\" Okasan said. The Tokyo Games are scheduled to open on July 23, but the capital and other economic hubs in Japan are seeing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases. Hospitals in the western city of Osaka are struggling to cope with the spike in infections, and Japan's government has imposed a state of emergency for the city and its surrounding areas, as well as in Tokyo. Doctors and medical experts are increasingly speaking out against holding the pandemic-postponed Games, while polls have long suggested that the public largely support a cancellation or a delay. The dollar stood at 108.89 yen, little changed from 108.92 yen in New York overnight. The government said Japan's factory output in March rose 2.2 percent from the previous month. Among major shares, Sony Group plunged 5.67 percent to 11,140 yen. Chipmaker Murata Manufacturing dropped 3.17 percent to 8,737 yen, and Toyota lost 1.16 percent to 8,203 yen. But SoftBank Group firmed 0.93 percent to 9,983 yen. Medical equipment maker Olympus added 0.27 percent to 2,255.5 yen. Nintendo rose 0.74 percent to 62,710 yen."

      "text": "3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks - The Motley Fool UK. In for a penny, in for a pound? Penny stocks can seem appealing. The idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling. But there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks. Here are three I’ve observed. Focus on price not value Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy — or the most expensive. Which would I prefer? The answer seems obvious. For most people, quality is worth paying for. Yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value. The legendary investor Warren Buffett said that “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. A penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value. But to assess what the underlying value is, I’d look not just at the price. I’dd also consider the company’s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value. Penny stocks and balance sheets One common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company’s balance sheet. Imagine buying a second hand car for £100. That might sound like a bargain. But if it needs to have an MOT the following week that identifies £3,000 of necessary repairs, even the £100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect. It’s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources. How will it pay them? Will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like Hammerson did last year? Balance sheets scare many people. But they aren’t as technical as they may sound. Before investing in any penny stocks I’d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company’s recent balance sheets. Seeing what a company’s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health, in my view. Single-asset focus A lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset. I find that’s particularly true with early-stage resource stocks. For example, Bacanora Lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in Mexico. Sometimes, such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards. If a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold, its return on capital could be huge. But the reverse is true as well – if a company is over-concentrated in one asset, the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it. Single-asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk, in many cases. That matters because, as Warren Buffett reminds us: “Rule number one: never lose money. Rule number two: never forget rule number one”. That can be hard to do. But by learning from common mistakes other investors make, I hope I can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio. "

      "text": "#Newsmaker: Cassandra Wingrove heading up sales at Mickey Llew's Australian office. Performance marketing and SEO agency Mickey Llew recently appointed Cassandra Wingrove to lead growth and development at its Australian office. She has been tasked with developing and coordinating growth opportunities to reach the company’s sales objectives of $1.2 AUD (R14m). She will also provide broad operational day-to-day support to the team as the Australian offering and services were previously managed from the Johannesburg head office. Wingrove has a BA Degree in Communications and an Honours in Psychology from the University of Johannesburg and brings a wealth of experience gained from the digital marketing sector. Some of her core capabilities include forecasting the budgeting cycle, managing the financial reporting, developing online communication strategies and providing business intelligence. She says she’s excited to be joining the agency at such a crucial and dynamic period in its growth journey, with the Australian expansion. “I am thrilled to be joining Mickey Llew at such an exciting time as the business expands into Australia. It is also a very interesting time for digital with more opportunities than ever before. Will you be based in South Africa or Australia? I am based in Australia and have lived in Sydney for the past five years. What is your job title and what does your role entail exactly? Head of Sales. I am focusing on building the foundations of the Australian Office, through new client acquisition and also managing the day-to-day operations. We do also have plans to grow out the Australian team. How you plan to navigate the Australian office through these unusual times? These are challenging times around the world, however, a silver lining is that it has allowed certain industries to flourish, such as e-commerce. There have been more opportunities for agencies like Mickey Llew as SEO has never been so important, especially with travel being restricted. It has pushed consumers to discover local businesses nearby. What excites you most about the agency and the Australian office in part? The opportunity at hand. Mickey Llew has built a reputable name for themselves in the South African market by forming strong relationships with their clients, delivering bespoke services and achieving bankable results. This has laid a strong foundation to scale the business fairly quickly and will allow us to build out an Australian-based team. What are you most looking forward to or enjoying thus far? I am enjoying networking with other agencies and business owners. Tell us more about your background/experience and how this has equipped you for the role. I have been in the tech industry for the past seven years. Most of my time was spent at a global media intelligence company, which allowed me to be exposed to running new business processes across IMEA. I was then transferred to the company’s office based in Australia, where I worked across their key account clients. This gave me exposure to many Australian businesses across different industries. I have also been involved in a sideline business of selling on Amazon marketplace in the USA, which has given me a good understanding of some of the foundations that make up SEO, such as keyword research, product listing and running effective campaigns. What do you love most about your career? I love working in the tech industry because I believe in progress. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. We spread knowledge, make tasks easier and make systems more efficient. Also, the industry is fast-paced and always evolving, meaning that there is always something new to learn. What’s at the top of your to-do list? To start building out our local partnerships with other agencies and businesses. What are you currently reading/watching/listening to? I love listening to podcasts whilst I exercise. As a mom of two little boys, the ability to multitask is an essential personality trait. I am currently listening to Kate Toon’s The Recipe for SEO Success, the Serious Sellers Podcast and SEO for the Rest of Us with Brendan Hufford. Tell us something about yourself not generally known? I have my Springbok colours for cheerleading. I competed in two World Championships held in the USA."

In an incident highlighting the issue, a 55-year-old man allegedly ended his life by suicide in Rajkot city on Wednesday after his wife tested positive for Covid-19. According to police, the deceased, identified as Hashmukh Chavda, was a resident of Valkeshwar society in Rajkot city. Chavda and his wife Nirmalaben went for Covid-19 testing on Wednesday morning. Nirmalaben tested positive for Covid-19 so their son Rajendra took her to a doctor for further treatment. Chavda, alone at home during that time, allegedly committed suicide. When Nirmalaben and Rajendra returned home they found him hanging from a ceiling fan. “Chavda’s son Rajendra told police that his father was worried about getting infected with the virus after Nirmalaben tested positive and therefore he ended his life,” police said. Rajendra Chavda works as a goldsmith while his father used to work as a mason. Though the numbers aren’t alarming as of now, a disturbing trend of positive persons developing suicidal tendencies has come to the fore. In last 10 days, at least five Covid-19 patients have ended their lives by committing suicides in different parts of Saurashtra region."

      "text": "Royal Canadian Mint Reports Profits and Performance for 2020. OTTAWA, ON, April 30, 2021 /CNW/ - The Royal Canadian Mint (the \"Mint\") is pleased to announce its financial results for 2020 that provide insight into our activities, the markets influencing our businesses and our expectations for the next 12 months. \"In 2020, employees of the Royal Canadian Mint demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver great products in a very challenging operating environment\" said Marie Lemay, President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint. \"Their hard work contributed to the Mint's success. Employees pivoted quickly in the face of disruption allowing the Mint to generate strong profits.\"   \"The Mint continues to respond to the unprecedented situation with COVID-19 in a proactive way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. We have adapted our production to be able to continue delivering critical services in support of the essential mining and financial sectors, while adhering to strict new protocols to ensure our work environment is a safe one.\" \"One very special initiative in 2020 was our Recognition Medal, created to recognize frontline workers while raising money for the Breakfast Club of Canada's COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Employees donated their time to this project and thanks to their generosity and the contrinutions of thousands of Canadians, the Mint was able to make a $400,000 donation to the Breakfast Club in 2020.\"  The financial results should be read in conjunction with the Mint's annual report available at www.mint.ca. All monetary amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Financial and Operational Highlights The Mint increased its revenue by 74% in 2020 as a result of exceptionally strong global market demand for bullion while consolidated profit before income tax and other items was $27.5 million for the year (2019 – $42.3 million). Higher bullion volumes sold in 2020 increased the Mint's revenue and cost of sales proportionately; however, the Mint's profit margin was impacted in 2020 by lower revenue from its other businesses, without a corresponding decrease in costs. In particular, the Mint continued to pay its employees and did not reduce any fixed costs during the periods of suspended or modified production as a result of the pandemic impacting the Mint's profit margin in 2020 by approximately $6 million. Consolidated revenue increased to $2,527.6 million in 2020 (2019 - $1,453.4 million). Gold bullion volumes increased more than 100% year over year and were 982.8 thousand ounces (2019 – 483.0 thousand ounces) while silver bullion volumes were 29.5 million ounces (2019 – 22.8 million ounces). Sales of numismatic products decreased to $91.9 million in 2020 (2019 - $116.8 million) due mainly to the temporary suspension of numismatic product production as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. Revenue from the Foreign Circulation business decreased 2% to $64.2 million (2019 - $65.4 million) with production and/or shipments of 838 million coins in 2020 and blanks compared to 1,308 million coins and blanks in 2019. Canadian circulation coins produced and sold to the Department of Finance for inventory were 229 million pieces in 2020 (2019 – 385 million pieces) while coins sold to financial institutions to meet demand decreased 8% year over year. Operating expenses, overall, increased 4% year over year to $98.5 million (2019 – $94.5 million) as the Mint focused on enhanced organizational resiliency in 2020 and the development of its updated long-term strategic vision and the strategy for the Mint's future business transformation.   Cash and cash equivalents increased to $67.3 million (December 31, 2019 - $65.5 million) after the Mint declared and paid a $20 million dividend to its Shareholder, the Government of Canada, in 2020. Cash and cash equivalents remain at the level required to support the Mint's operations.   Consolidated results and financial performance(in CAD $ millions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019)  Year ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 2,527.6 $ 1,453.4 $ 1,074.2 74 Profit before income tax and other items1 $ 27.5 $ 42.3 $ (14.8) (35) Profit before income tax and other items margin 1.1% 2.9% Profit for the period $ 37.7 $ 34.8 (1)   A reconciliation from profit for the period to profit before income tax and other items is included on page 35 of the Mint's 2020 annual report.   As at December 31, 2020 December 31,  2019 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 67.3 $ 65.5 $ 1.8 3 Inventories $ 57.6 $ 94.9 $ (37.3) (39) Capital assets $ 161.1 $ 173.9 $ (12.8) (7) Total assets $ 379.4 $ 429.9 $ (50.5) (12) Working capital $ 112.9 $ 102.5 $ 10.4 10 As part of its business continuity plan, the Mint continues to actively monitor its global supply chain and logistics networks in support of its continued operations.

      "text": "‘Waiting to die’: India grieves with bodies arriving in crematoriums ‘non-stop’, as COVID-19 death toll climbs. As new infections increase at a record rate, people in India are dying waiting for beds with oxygen supplies running low, and hospitals crumbling under the strain. Those on the ground claim the fatalities are being markedly underreported as people are dying 'left, right and centre.'        By Avneet Arora        WARNING: Distressing content Socked in a tiny village in Gumtala in India’s northern state of Punjab, Rani thought her family was insulated from the perils of the pandemic that has gripped the country, primarily urban India. Little did she know that virus is immune to the structural divide and would penetrate her home and claim the lives of three members of her family, in three days. Highlights: 'I went to the cremation ground three times in three days' “I went to the cremation ground three times in three days,” says the inconsolable 55-year-old Rani whose family has been tethered by the perilous virus that is roughly claiming 117 lives every hour. “First my daughter-in-law died of COVID on April 20, then it claimed my son on April 21 and then my younger son’s grown-up child took ill. He too passed away after a few hours of his uncle’s death,” she says as she sobs on the phone. Rani’s village is approximately 10 miles away from the nearest city Amritsar that houses the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine. The gutted mother says with her entire family of six down with COVID-19, they did not have any support to take those critical to the hospital in the city. ‘It’s getting scarier by the minute’ Rani’s horror story is being repeated across the country, particularly in the capital city New Delhi, the epicentre of the deadly second wave, which has recorded over 3,000 deaths in the last ten days, according to the health ministry data. Brisbane-based Raj whose 78-year-old mother has tested positive is currently hunkered at a distant relative’s house in Delhi because there’s no one to take care of her. The 38-year-old whose outward exemption was revoked after the travel ban says he doesn’t want his mother to become another statistic in the rising death toll. “I can’t be there with her and she is stuck at my aunt’s house in Delhi. Every time the phone rings, my heart stops because I fear for her wellbeing. The only respite is that she is at home and doesn’t have too many symptoms at this point,” Raj says. “Every time I switch on the TV, all I see is bodies wrapped in white bags piled on vehicles. It’s getting scarier by the minute,” he adds. ‘Bodies are coming in non-stop’ The political seat of the South Asian country is witnessing a staggering number of new infections daily, where survival has now become a luxury as people scramble for hospital beds, oxygen, ambulances, and a spot to lay their loved ones to rest. Jyotjeet Singh, the director of the disaster cell at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal, a charity group that has been facilitating cremations for COVID-afflicted fatalities tells SBS Punjabi that the waiting time to get to a pyre is anywhere between eight to ten hours at the Seemapuri crematorium, a site in northeast Delhi where the group carries out cremations. “Bodies are piling up. It’s 8:30 pm (local time) on 28 April and we have cremated over 144 bodies in a day at this site alone. Last week, we were so overwhelmed with bodies that at one point, we ran out of wood for the pyres and had to appeal to people to send logs,” he says. Mr Singh says bodies are coming in “non-stop” and warns that if this goes on for a few more days, they will have to start burning the remains on the roadside. “There is no help from the government whatsoever. We have made a makeshift cremation site at the park in the vicinity. Now that is also incapacitated, and we have started to cremate in the parking lot. I wouldn’t be surprised when even crematoriums would start turning away people,” he says. He claims many deaths are going unaccounted for, especially in cases where people are dying at home while they are quarantined. “There is a gross underreporting of the number of deaths. Casualties are at least ten times more than the official figure being reported by the government. There is no record or digital footprint of people who never got tested or were hospitalised, and have succumbed to the virus at their homes. People are dying left, right and centre,” Mr Singh adds. Crematoriums are melting: Calling it one of the grimmest times in India’s history, Mr P Patel, a worker at the Kurukshetra Crematorium in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home turf Gujarat says that last week, the chimney at the site melted as a result of overheating caused by round the clock cremations in the gas furnaces at the premises. “Chimneys are getting overheated because they aren’t getting time to cool down. Last year around this time, we got a maximum of 25 bodies at the height of the wave, now we are receiving over 100 bodies in a day. It's that bad,” he says. Civilians stepping up to help: As many struggle after testing positive, those still safe are striving to help others. Samir Singh, the chairman and managing director of the Delhi-based Sikh Chamber of Commerce has set up a helpline service with a help of over 75 volunteers. “We have set up a helpline service through which we are helping people to locate hospitals which have oxygen supplies, critical care beds and we are also sending ambulances to people in need,” he says. Mr Singh says people are reaching out to him and his team through phone, WhatsApp groups and social media or word of mouth. “They contact us from far and wide and we ensure that patients are connected with providers. We do not randomly provide them with contacts, but we verify them to ensure that if they are claiming to have oxygen cylinders, its not a hoax because patients or their families don’t have time to do this spadework,” the 42-year-old says. Indian Australians doing their bit: Devastated by the news trickling in from India, Brisbane-based Karanpreet Singh is raising funds for people battling the virus in India. The 30-year-old father of two says funds raised would be sent to a registered not for profit group in Punjab that will be using the money to buy oxygen concentrators. “The idea is to help. We are sitting miles away from our families and loved ones. At this point, almost every household is impacted be it physically, emotionally, or financially. I know people are sceptical to donate, but I’d say so your bit in whichever way you can,” Mr Singh says. Click on the player above to listen to the interview.

      "text": "Hammersmith Bridge: Bridge of sighs and a shameful collective catalogue of failure. Clemmie Watkins used to have a 10-minute walk to school across . Since September, it has become a 40-minute bike ride via  on roads plagued by speeding drivers and riverside paths that flood when the Thames rises. On winter nights, even adults avoid her unlit route home across Dukes Meadows, a haunt of muggers and doggers. On Wednesday the 13-year-old slipped and fell crossing a wet Barnes bridge, cutting herself and ruining her school skirt. “It’s really annoying,” she said. “If it floods it’s so much longer in the rain. It’s not good.” by Hammersmith and Fulham council when cracks were detected in its pedestals. The crossing was kept open to pedestrians and cyclists until August last year, but the cracks widened. Since then, the effect on  has been “catastrophic”, . About 4,000 vehicles a day divert via her Putney constituency. Even at 7am, the already polluted approaches to Putney bridge, the nearest alternative crossing, are gridlocked. The inability to reopen the bridge has made London a laughing stock. Politicians blame each other while residents despair. Ms Anderson describes it as an “international embarrassment”. It has even made the New York Times. On September 9 last year, Transport Secretary , accompanied by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, visited the bridge. In a video, Mr Shapps vowed to “take control” and “get it fixed and reopened”. . Yesterday it met for the 15th time. The taskforce includes representatives from Transport for London and Heidi Alexander, Sadiq Khan’s deputy mayor for transport. But Mr Khan said this week that the taskforce had been little more than a “talking shop to kick the can down the road”. Clemmie’s mother, Julia Watkins, a member of the Hammersmith Bridge SOS residents’ group, agrees. “You can’t walk over a taskforce,” she said. “They have done nothing. They were meant to be knocking heads together. Baroness Vere points the finger at Hammersmith and Fulham council. The council points the finger at Grant Shapps.” A resident survey found some feeling suicidal because of the closure. Almost nine in 10 said they had suffered worse mental health. The apolitical Hammersmith Society, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said: “The communities on both sides of the river are unified in their anger, their disappointment and their despair.” There is a growing acknowledgement that only the Government has the financial might to break the deadlock. The council owns the bridge but cannot afford the £141 million restoration bill. Mr Shapps wants the council to pay half the bill.  has provided about £20 million for investigations and design work, including £4 million for a temporary ferry and repairs from a government Covid bail-out last year. “The Government should be able to break this deadlock,” Ms Watkins said. “They could have straightaway funded a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge. Instead they went for this ludicrous ferry. It’s completely inadequate.” Even the ferry has been delayed. An initial plan was to have it start operating last autumn. Uber Boat by Thames Clippers has won the contract but two temporary piers have yet to be constructed. Residents fear services may not start until November. “Our contract is to have it running by the beginning of October, but we are in negotiations with TfL to accelerate that,” said a spokesman for Beckett Rankine, which will design the piers. “TfL would like it ready at the start of September, but there are a lot of things that have to go right. Normally it would take a year to build a new pier.” The contract between TfL and Thames Clippers is for a minimum of 12 months, to a maximum of five years. Adults will be charged £1.55 per crossing, though children will travel free. There will be two ferries, with a third as back-up. The crossing will take 90 seconds, with a boat every five to seven minutes in peak hours. “It will be a huge improvement for the residents,” the Beckett Rankine spokesman said. “It will be a very slick service. Thames Clippers know what they are doing.” The source added: “It’s a lot cheaper than a temporary bridge.” The council’s preferred option is a “double decker” bridge. Designed by architects Foster + Partners and specialist bridge engineers COWI, it would cost about £100 million — £41 million less than fully restoring the existing bridge. This could allow the bridge to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists in summer next year, and to drivers two months later — four years earlier than otherwise planned. But motorists would face an estimated £3 toll. The other hope for a “quick win” rests with engineers who have analysed the structural integrity of the pedestals. It may be the case that the ironwork has stabilised and the bridge could be safe to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists. The engineers’ report was submitted to the DfT three weeks ago. But sources say that “further engineering analysis and checks need to be completed” — and this could take a further three months. Behind the scenes there is concern about safety. The Government wants the council to retain liability should anything go wrong. Residents are furious at the thought that a “risk-averse culture” could be used as an excuse to keep the bridge closed. “On that basis, politicians should close every bridge in the country,” one said, noting that teenagers continue to climb the railings to cross the bridge at night and use it as a skateboard park. “If they continue to do that after the engineers’ report shows it’s safe, that is just despicable. They’re ruining people’s lives.” The key date is when the clocks go back in October, when the thousands a day who follow Clemmie’s route risk being stranded on the wrong side of the river. Michelle Coulter, another member of Hammersmith Bridge SOS, whose daughters Iris, 16, and Lana, 13, also attend school in Hammersmith, said children were often unable to board the replacement buses. Under Covid rules, the single-deckers can only carry 14 passengers. “Since August it’s become so stressful, I cannot tell you,” she said. “My youngest finishes school at 4pm. In winter she was getting home at 5.30pm, sometimes 6pm. That was by bus.” Mr Khan accuses the Government of “dither and delay” and failing to honour promises made before the 2019 General Election. The council submitted its double-decker bridge proposal in February, but it is regarded by the DfT to be lacking detail. Two weeks ago, minister Rachel Maclean accused the council of wearing “gold-tinted lenses” and said a “blank cheque” would not be forthcoming. The DfT said it could not comment due to pre-election purdah restrictions. Sadiq Khan (Lab) Keen to have the bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists if engineers find the structure safe but says the bridge will only fully reopen to vehicles when the Government covers the bulk of the cost. A TfL-funded ferry service is due to start in the autumn. Shaun Bailey (Con) Promises to make the ferry free, build a temporary road bridge and fully repair the existing bridge, which he would rename the Prince Philip bridge. Says it is essential the bridge can carry vehicles and would not impose a toll on motorists. Says TfL should have funded the full repairs as soon as the bridge closed in 2019. He would fund his ideas by establishing a TfL investment fund. Sian Berry (Green) Believes the Department for Transport should provide “at least the majority of the costs” of repairing the bridge, and wants a date to be set for the reopening of the bridge for walking and cycling.

      "text": "Lucea Primary School fighting back challenges caused. THE Lucea Primary School, which provided educational instruction to thousands of students from across Hanover and adjacent parishes, is fighting back the the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Principal of the 62-year-old institution, Yazmin Anderson Jackson, says the students and staff have embraced the changes that have transformed the modalities of lessons that are delivered and how stakeholders interact with each other. Students preparing for the Grade Six Primary Exit Profile (PEP) Ability Test were given an opportunity to have face-to-face classes between February 1, 2021 and March 18, 2021. However, the spike in COVID-19 cases in the parish has forced classes to return online. Grade six social studies teacher Francena Black is highly motivated and hopes to pass on her enthusiasm to her students. Black, who is faced with the daily challenges of keeping her students motivated, said being online requires new approaches to lesson delivery. She has incorporated different modalities to maintain her students' interest. One such method is through the use of different resource persons to teach subjects in their areas of expertise. “We find that it really gets them engaged. Having [different resource persons] throughout the day, we find that this makes a great difference,” Black said, citing “guest teachers” from the Forestry Department, the Hanover Municipal Corporation and the Jamaica Information Service . The school, which had its genesis in an old soldier barracks near the seaside, is currently located in Malcolm Heights, which overlooks the aquamarine waters of Lucea Harbour. At present, there are more than 625 students on roll and 31 teachers on staff. Lucea Primary is propelled by the vision of excellence for all. In light of this, programmes are implemented to help students become well rounded. The motto, 'Soaring High on Integrity', alludes to that. Anderson Jackson is proud to note that students have earned scholarships due to their high academic performance. “Over the years, we have excellent performances at the JCDC festival, winning many gold medals as well as silver medals in dance, music and speech,” she said. “Students are also involved in sports and have been crowned parish champions in cricket and football,” Anderson Jackson notes, pointing out that the school has showcased its talents in Spanish and 4-H competitions and continues to provide these avenues for self-expression and development for its students. She said that COVID-19 has forced the school to use the Google Suite platform, and “we have been coping quite well” Despite the challenges of poor Internet connectivity in some areas, loss of electricity occasionally and the lack of devices for some students, Anderson Jackson is optimistic that her school community will continue to rise. “Our highly trained staff goes beyond the call of duty to ensure that students are catered for at all levels and that the school lives up to its mission to provide a system which secures quality holistic education for all students,” she told JIS News.

      "text": "Advertorial (?) in the Australian from Anzac Day ..cheers https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dgo-gold-aiming-to-strike-a-balance-in-gold-exploration/news-story/231d9ce048bfd7d7f87545741008db15DGO Gold aiming to strike a balance in gold explorationDGO Gold is hoping it has created a strategic investment model that will reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia. Picture: BloombergDAMON KITNEYVICTORIAN BUSINESS EDITOR6:42PM APRIL 25, 2021Melbourne investment banker Bruce Parncutt calls his latest plaything a “gold discovery company”.Neither an explorer nor a miner, the ASX-listed DGO Gold — of which Mr Parncutt has been an executive director for the past year — is looking to carve out a unique niche in the Australian gold sector.Its game plan is to make strategic equity investments in West Australian brownfield gold discoveries, bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely-ignored exploration opportunities.Mr Parncutt said he hopes DGO has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in Australia.“Gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation. We do the mining part well but I’m not so sure we do the exploration part well. Especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale,” he said. “Most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore. We think we are adding intelligent value to that process.” DGO is also a unique human story, combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of McIntosh Securities in Mr Parncutt, with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector’s most famed geologists, Ed Eshuys.As Joseph Gutnick’s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr Eshuys led the teams that discovered the Plutonic, Bronzewing and Jundee gold deposits and the Cawse nickel deposit. Before those triumphs, Mr Eshuys also had involvement in the Maggie Hays and Mariners nickel discoveries in the 1970s.He is now DGO Gold’s executive chairman and is working closely with Mr Parncutt — who has been on the board since 2018 — and DGO’s management team to develop two sizeable WA gold resources and to explore for more.“We do bring together a unique set of skills. It is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills” Mr Eshuys said.“Bruce and I do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus. That has led us to a disciplined approach to take DGO from where it was to where it is now.”DGO Gold directors Ed Eshuys and Bruce Parncutt.DGO Gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects. Ten ASX juniors made the shortlist before DGO narrowed it down to two, taking strategic stakes in booming Pilbara gold explorer De Grey Mining and Leonora gold explorer NTM Gold.DGO has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled, including on prime South Australian ground owned by junior explorer Investigator Resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter’s Pernatty copper project. DGO also has a 40 per cent interest in Yilgarn Exploration Ventures, which is drilling in the Leonora district of Western Australia.“One of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn’t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale,” Mr Eshuys said.“Part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly. That is where De Grey came to the party. They did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that.”The strategy has seen DGO Gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago, and $1.70 last year when Mr Parncutt became an executive, to close on Friday at $3.63.They soared over $4 in September last year on the back of the coronavirus-fuelled surge in the gold price, which saw it spike to $US2056 per ounce last August.While gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising US Treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery, the DGO share price has held up.DGO now owns 16 per cent of De Grey, which is drilling out a significant Pilbara gold discovery. It also has board representation and has supported De Grey’s capital raisings, including a $25m round last September.“De Grey is in a unique position in terms of its Pilbara land position. That is one of our key elements when we invest and explore,” Mr Eshuys said.Following the merger late last year of NTM Gold with Dacian Gold, DGO will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in Dacian.Of the $25m raised last September, $8m was also pegged for greenfield exploration.The value of DGO’s stake in De Grey covers its $225m market capitalisation, meaning the market is currently attributing no value to DGO’s substantial exploration interests.DGO has attracted some big name investors, including stockbroking veteran Tom Klinger, one of Christopher Skase’s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former McIntosh managing director. Others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser Peter Woodford, the rich-lister Costa family member Robert Costa and Regal Funds Management."

      "text": "Europe oil firms post huge profits as crude rallies. Paris—European oil majors have posted strong quarterly profits as a recovery in crude prices fueled their rebound from the coronavirus crisis. France’s Total, Britain’s BP, Anglo-Dutch group Shell and Spain’s Repsol have this week posted $14.5 billion in first-quarter profits between them. At the same time, the companies renewed their commitments to investing in renewable energies. It’s a huge turnaround from last year, when global lockdowns decimated economic activity and oil prices fell off a cliff, taking the energy giants’ balance sheets with them. Royal Dutch Shell led the way posting a $5.7-billion (4.7 billion euros) net profit in the first quarter on Thursday following a loss in the same period last year. BP also returned to the black, booking a $4.7-billion profit while Total added $3.3 billion, even outstripping pre-pandemic levels. Repsol, browbeaten by two years of huge losses, scored a $783-million gain. The results are a boon for the majors, who made tens of billions of cumulative losses last year as the health pandemic took hold and prices collapsed. Prices have returned to pre-pandemic since them, exceeding $60 per barrel. Goldman Sachs analyst see prices rising to $80 in the next six months. “These are profitable price levels and it is not a surprise that oil companies have published strong results,” said Michael Tamvakis, commodity economics professor at London’s Business School. Oil prices should remain strong as the driving and flying season restarts later in May and June, Tamvakis said. “So for now, oil companies have weathered the storm,” he said. The profits are also a reflection that some companies are slimming down their staff levels. Shell decided to ax more than 10 percent of its global workforce, or up to 9,000 jobs. Shell, like some of its peers, has also been shedding assets. That gave it a $1.4-billion boost in the first quarter.   “Shell has made a strong start to 2021, generating over $8 billion of cash in the quarter,” said chief executive Ben van Beurden. He added that Shell’s model is ideally positioned to benefit from recovering demand. “Fortunately for investors these latest results come without the drama seen this time last year when Shell cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War,” said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor. Shell this time around increased its dividend payout by about 4.0 percent compared with the final quarter of last year. "

      "text": "Global gold demand, first quarter near low level for the first time in 13 years Investor sales. [London, 29th Reuters] --Global gold demand in the first quarter of this year has remained near its lowest level since 2008, according to a quarterly report released by the World Gold Council (WGC), an international gold research institute. It was. While Asian consumer buying has returned, investor sales have expanded in Europe and North America. Last year, as the spread of the new coronavirus hit the global economy, investors were increasingly buying gold as a safe haven. At the same time, lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have slowed sales of gold jewelery, gold nuggets and gold coins in China and India, which are normally the two biggest consumers. As the global economy recovers, this trend is now reversing, with investors shrinking their holdings and Asian consumer buying returning. According to the WGC, global gold demand from January to March this year was 815.7 tons, a slight increase from 813.7 tons in the previous quarter. However, it decreased by 23% year-on-year. Consumer demand in China was 286.4 tonnes, the highest level since the first quarter of 2017. On the other hand, exchange-traded fund (ETF) gold holdings fell by 177.9 tons, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2013. Due to the sale by ETF, the gold price fell from the record high of 1 ounce = $ 2072.50 in August last year to around $ 1,700 in March. According to the WGC, this helped boost demand for Asians. In April, ETF sales slowed sharply and gold prices picked up towards $ 1800. WGC analyst Christian Gopaul said consumers and investors&#39; demand for gold this year is likely to remain resilient, albeit below its recent peak. Gold purchased by the central bank in the first quarter was 95.5 tonnes, the highest level since the second quarter of last year. However, it was well below the typical level seen in 2018 and 2019.

Canada Nickel (CNC) owns 100% of the Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide project: A new nickel discovery with large scale potential in an established mining camp adjacent to existing infrastructure north of Timmins, Ontario, Canada.    One of the top 10 nickel sulphide resources globally, with significant expansion potential    Initial metallurgical testing confirmed excellent nickel recovery of 46%, 51% and 52% from the first 3 locked cycle tests using conventional flowsheet design. Latest testing show 15% less grinding energy required    Nickel mineralization in Crawford extended to Main, East, West and North Zones, with total strike length of ~7 km. New target from MacDiarmid option property 15% larger than original Crawford Main Zone    Groundbreaking, mutually beneficial MOUs signed with local First Nations    Canada Nickel has launched wholly-owned NetZero Metals Inc. to develop zero-carbon production of Nickel, Cobalt and Iron - has applied for trademarks NetZero Nickel TM , NetZero Cobalt TM , NetZero Iron TM    Canada Nickel is completing a PEA on the Crawford Project by May 2021, FS by year-end 2021    MOU signed with Glencore to examine potential to use Kidd Creek mill and met site to allow faster, significantly lower capital cost startup.    Canada Nickel is well timed - nickel appears to be entering a supercycle which occur every 15-20 years.    Prices should remain at relatively high levels for an extended period to incent new supply to meet already strong demand growth further accelerated by substantial requirements from electric vehicles    Nickel has limited investible opportunities - Prior supercycle in 2005-2007 largely emptied project pipeline outside Indonesia. * Mineral Resource Estimate prepared by Caracle 3 Creek International Consulting Inc.

      "text": "Under-supplied metal palladium races past $3,000/oz for first time. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT.       Palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on Friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. Palladium was last up 1% to $2,984.68 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3,007.73. It was on track to post a monthly gain as well. \"Palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. We have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. \"The commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. This rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward.\" Demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. But Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. \"At this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum).\" A shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. Meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 GMT. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,769.00. Data showed on Thursday that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. Separately, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Silver fell 0.5% to $25.96 per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last December. Platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Peter Hobson in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)    Dear Reader,  Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

      "text": "3 stellar ASX growth shares for investors in May. Are you look for a growth share to buy next month? Three that could be worth considering are listed below. All three have been growing strongly in recent years and look well-placed for more of the same during the 2020s. Here’s what you need to know about these ASX growth shares:  Adore Beauty Group Limited   (ASX: ABY)  Adore Beauty is Australia’s leading online beauty retailer. It has been growing very strongly during the pandemic. So much so, it almost tripled its operating earnings to $5.2 million during the first half of FY 2021. Despite this, the Adore Beauty share price recently hit a record low. This has been driven by broad weakness among ecommerce shares. One broker that believes it has a long runway for growth and sees this weakness as a buying opportunity is UBS. Earlier this month it put a buy rating and $6.20 price target on its shares.  Megaport Ltd  (ASX: MP1)  Another growth share to look at is Megaport. It is an elasticity connectivity and network services company. Its increasingly popular service allows businesses to increase and decrease their available bandwidth in response to their own demand requirements. Demand has been strong, leading to Megaport growing at a rapid rate over the last few years. Pleasingly, this has continued in FY 2021. Earlier this month it released its third quarter update and revealed an 8% quarter on quarter increase in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to $6.8 million. This went down well with UBS, which retained its buy rating and lifted its price target to $17.10.  Xero Limited  (ASX: XRO)  A final growth share to look at is Xero. It provides small and medium sized businesses with a cloud-based business and accounting solution. It has been growing strongly over the last few years thanks to its international expansion, acquisitions, and the transition to the cloud. Positively, all these drivers are still in place and should be supported by its burgeoning app ecosystem. If the company can monetise this ecosystem and continue its international expansion, it could support decades of strong revenue growth according to Goldman Sachs. The broker currently has a buy rating and $153.00 price target on its shares.    Where to invest $1,000 right now  When investing expert Scott Phillips has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the flagship Motley Fool Share Advisor newsletter he has run for more than eight years has provided thousands of paying members with stock picks that have doubled, tripled or even more.* Scott just revealed what he believes are the five best ASX stocks for investors to buy right now.

See The 5 Stocks *Returns as of February 15th 2021 More reading    The Xero (ASX:XRO) share price is smashing the ASX 50 this month   2 outstanding ASX growth shares that could be great buy and hold options   The Credit Clear (ASX:CCR) share price lower on third quarter update   The Tyro Payments (ASX:TYR) share price has gained 30% in 12 months   Why the Adore Beauty (ASX:ABY) share price is charging higher today   James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Apple Faces EU Antitrust Action for 'Abusing' Music Streaming Dominance By: TheStreet | April 30, 2021 • 'By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,' the EU says. Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares slipped lower Friday after European Union officials charged the world's biggest tech company with abusing its dominance in the music streaming market. The EU's Competition Commission said Apple uses restrictions within its App store that prevent rivals from informing iPhone and iPad users of cheaper alternatives to Apple Music while charging higher fees that distort competition. EU rules allow for fines that could reach 10% of Apple's annual sales, which hit $275.5 billion in the fiscal year ending on September 28. The Commission levied a record $5 billion fine against Goggle parent Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report in 2018 following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps. “App stores play a central role in today's digital economy. We can now do our shopping, access news, music or movies via apps instead of visiting websites,\" said the Commission's Executive Vice President, Margrethe Vestager. \"Our preliminary finding is that Apple is a gatekeeper to users of iPhones and iPads via the App Store. With Apple Music, Apple also competes with music streaming providers.\" \"By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,\" she added. \"This is done by charging high commission fees on each transaction in the App store for rivals and by forbidding them from informing their customers of alternative subscription options.” Apple shares were marked 0.7% lower in early trading following the EU charges and changing hands at $132.60 each.

The China Gold Association announced that the domestic raw material gold production in the first quarter of this year was 74.44 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 9.92%. Among them, China National Gold, Shandong Gold, Zijin Mining, Shandong Zhaojin and other large gold conglomerates produced 30.78 tons of mineral gold, accounting for the proportion of the country. Up to 52.25%. According to the association, the actual consumption of gold in the country during the period was 288.2 tons, an increase of 93.9% year-on-year. Among them, gold jewellery was 169.18 tons, an increase of 83.81%. Based on the low base caused by the outbreak in the same period last year, and the results of China&#39;s overall epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development gradually appearing, the gold consumption in the first quarter has returned to the level of the same period in 2019. The scale of domestic gold ETFs continued to grow in the first quarter, with a total increase of 11.5 tons. As of the end of March, domestic gold ETF holdings were about 72.4 tons. The association stated that high-quality resources and high-quality productivity are further concentrated in large gold companies. The fall in gold prices has also prompted an increase in demand from industrial gold companies. The improvement in the macro economy and the fall in gold prices have caused physical gold investment to continue the high heat in the fourth quarter of last year, with a sharp rise year-on-year. In the first quarter of 2021, with the turnaround of the global epidemic and the steady progress of vaccination, as well as the continuous strengthening of the U.S. dollar under the large-scale fiscal stimulus of the Biden government of the United States, the price of gold fluctuated and corrected during the period."

      "text": "Resolution Minerals Ltd  Acuity At-the-Market Subscription Agreement Renewed. Adelaide, Australia (ABN Newswire) - Resolution Minerals Ltd (ASX:RML) (FRA:NC3) is pleased to announce it has entered into an At-the-Market Subscription Agreement (ATM) with Acuity Capital. The ATM provides RML with up to $3 million of working capital and standby equity capital over the coming 32-month period. The facility, if utilised, would allow existing funds to be focussed on exploration. Importantly, RML retains full control of all aspects of the subscription process: having sole discretion as to whether or not to utilise the ATM, the maximum number of shares to be issued, the minimum issue price of shares and the timing of each subscription (if any). There are no requirements on RML to utilise the ATM and RML may terminate the ATM at any time, without cost or penalty. Acuity Capital and the ATM do not place any restrictions at any time on RML raising capital through other methods. If RML does decide to utilise the ATM, RML is able to set an issue price floor (at its sole discretion), with the final issue price being calculated as the greater of that floor price set by RML and up to a 10% discount to a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over a period of RML's choosing (again at the sole discretion of RML). As security for the ATM, RML has agreed to place 22 million RML shares from its LR7.1 capacity, at nil cash consideration to Acuity Capital. The Company may, however, at any time cancel the ATM as well as buy back (and cancel) those shares for no cash consideration (subject to shareholder approval). About Resolution Minerals Ltd: Resolution Minerals Ltd (ASX:RML) is a mining company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of precious and battery metals - such as gold, copper, cobalt, and vanadium.

      "text": "National karate fighters win medals at Unmei Cup-2021. By Laman Ismayilova Azerbaijani karate fighters have won two medals at Unmei Cup-2021 in Belarus.  The karate fighters of the Azerbaijan Emergencies Ministry's Sports and Recreation Center enriched the country's medal haul with gold and silver medals.  More than 450 karate fighters from seven countries took part in the international karate tournament.  Nijat Karimli (61 kg) took gold in kumite and silver in the individual championship. Nihad Karimzade (70 kg) also became a silver medalist. Their first coaches were honored coaches, 6th degree black belt holders Akif Kerimov and Rafael Mammadov. Now young karate fighters are trained by the two-time world champion in karate, holder of 8th degree black belt, first vice-president of the Azerbaijan Taekwondo Federation, director of the Sports and Health Center under the Azerbaijan Ministry of Emergencies, Colonel Fizuli Musayev. The coach has recently met with karate fighters and wished them further success. Notably, the national karate fighters will take part in Karate 1 Youth League to be held in Cyprus this June. Azerbaijani karate team is considered one of the strongest teams in Europe and the World. The National Karate Federation was founded in 1994. Three years later, it became a full member of the World Karate Federation (WKF). WKF is the only karate federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee, whose main objective is to combine the basic style of karate under the general rules of the competition and enter into the program of the Olympic Games. It is the largest and most powerful karate organization in the world, comprising 183 countries and more than 50 million members. Over the past few years, national karate fighters have won prestigious international tournaments, European and World championships. Rafael Aghayev has managed to achieve all of the highest sporting victories in karate; he is multiple European Champion and multiple World Champion. For outstanding sports achievements, he has repeatedly received awards from the leadership of the National Olympic Committee, the Youth and Sport Ministry of Azerbaijan Republic. The President of the World Karate Federation, Antonio Espinosa, called him \"Diamond of the Karate World.\" Rafael Aghayev won a gold medal in karate (kumite) competitions at the 4th Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku. He secured the gold medal thanks to a victory over Pakistani Ghulam Abbas in the 75kg division final. Irina Zaretska is also known for her numerous victories at the international area. She is the owner of the gold medal at the Premier League Karate1 2014 in Almere, bronze at \"World Karate Cup 2014\", gold at the Premier League Karate1 2015 in Istanbul, silver at the Premier League Karate1 2017, etc. Azerbaijani karate fighters showed their best at the 29th European Championship among cadets and juniors. Rafael Aghayev (60 kg) and Jeyhun Aghasiyev (65 kg) won gold medals among cadets for the first time. Rashad Huseynov (65 kg) grabbed bronze among juniors. --- Follow us on Twitter  @AzerNewsAz          "
